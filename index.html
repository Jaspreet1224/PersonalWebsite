            I am <strong>Jaspreet Singh</strong>, a Computer Science student at the University at Buffalo.
            I chose Computer Science because I have always loved to solve difficult problems and create solutions that
            people can benefit from. I am currently seeking a full-time position in which I can apply my skills and
            grow as a software engineer.

teach and share my love for dance with others. I also enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and spending 
time with friends and family.
